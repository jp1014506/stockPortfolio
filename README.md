Stock Portfolio Tracker
Introduction
    This project is my first attempt at learning JavaScript, and Iâ€™m using it as both a personal learning exercise and a way to showcase what Iâ€™m picking up along the way.
The script is a simple but expandable stock portfolio tracker. It allows you to add or remove stocks, keep track of how many shares you own, and calculate your portfolioâ€™s real-time market value using the Alpha Vantage API.
I see this project as the foundation of my JavaScript journey â€” something that starts basic but can grow into a more polished application as I continue to improve my skills.

Features
-Add & Remove Stocks
-Add stocks with a symbol and number of shares.
-Remove shares from existing holdings.
-Portfolio Tracking
-Maintains a running list of your current positions.
-Outputs clean, human-readable results.
-Live Price Fetching
-Uses Alpha Vantageâ€™s GLOBAL_QUOTE endpoint to fetch the latest stock prices.
Automatically calculates the value per holding and the total portfolio value.

Formatted Output
Numbers are formatted with commas and two decimal places for readability.
Clear breakdown of portfolio value with sectioned output.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jp1014506/stockPortfolio.git
cd stockPortfolio

Install dependencies:
npm install
Set up your Alpha Vantage API key:
Sign up at Alpha Vantage.
Create a .env file in the project root and add your key:
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Usage
Run the script using Node.js:
node "Stock Portfolio.js"
Sample output:
737 shares of NVDA added to your portfolio.
0.5 shares of VGT added to your portfolio.
APPL not found in portfolio.
You have 637 of NVDA left in your portfolio.
[ { symbol: 'NVDA', shares: 637 }, { symbol: 'VGT', shares: 0.5 } ]

ðŸ“Š Portfolio Breakdown:
--------------------------
NVDA: 637 shares @ $175.64 = $111,882.68
VGT: 0.5 shares @ $688.81 = $344.40
--------------------------

ðŸ’° Total Portfolio Value: $112,227.08

Future Improvements
âœ… Improve formatting (commas, rounding).
ðŸ”² Add persistent storage (JSON or database) so portfolio saves across runs.
ðŸ”² Build a simple web interface for real-time viewing.
ðŸ”² Add support for fractional shares & ETFs.
ðŸ”² Explore charting libraries to visualize portfolio growth.

Why This Project Matters to Me
-This portfolio tracker isnâ€™t just about stocks â€” itâ€™s about learning JavaScript fundamentals:
Working with arrays, loops, and objects.
-Handling API calls with fetch.
-Formatting and structuring real-world data.
-Iâ€™m using this as a showcase to track my progress, and over time I hope it becomes something I can point to as proof of what Iâ€™ve learned.
